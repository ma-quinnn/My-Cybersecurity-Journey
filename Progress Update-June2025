## 📅 June 2025 – Master Plan (No API Focus)

This month, the focus is to **continue building and showcasing real skills**, even without live API integration yet. We're using **UI Design + Fake Logic** to simulate real app behavior and build confidence, presentation, and visibility!

### 🧩 Goals:
| Focus Area                         | Why It Matters                                                            |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🎨 **UI Design + Fake Logic**       | Simulates BIZZ scans, builds user experience even without live APIs       |
| 💼 **Portfolio Enhancement**       | Embeds BIZZ v2 in the portfolio for real-time demo & employer showcase    |
| 📢 **LinkedIn Documentation**      | Publicly tracking progress to grow professional presence and credibility  |
| 🧠 **Continue Core Learning**       | Networking, Fundamentals, CLI, Scripting – these are your technical base |

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
Here’s what we’re doing step by step:

1. 🛠️ Your app just needs **API key + logic tweaks** = ✅ GO LIVE!
2. 🌐 Launch **BIZZ v2** publicly via your portfolio or own page
3. 📂 Add **full documentation** and clean, professional **GitHub repo**
4. 🧭 Share updates and articles on **LinkedIn** to attract employers
5. 🧠 Continue learning:
   - Networking Concepts (IP, Subnetting, DNS, etc.)
   - Linux & Command Lines (Kali tools, bash, scripting)
   - Python + Code logic for AI tools
   - SIEM Tools (Splunk in progress)

## 📌 Reminder
This is a **real journey** – not a course-only roadmap, but a *project-driven transformation*. Employers will not just see what I *studied*, but what I *built*, how I think, and how I grow.
