## 👩‍💻 About Me

Hi, I'm Mae ❤️ — known online as **quinnn_** in the tech and crypto space. I’m a self-taught cybersecurity learner from the Philippines, currently working overseas while building the foundation of my future in technology.

I don’t have a formal IT degree or tech background. I started this journey as a lash and nail technician — driven purely by grit, curiosity, and the dream of creating a better life through tech. My nights are spent studying, building, and documenting everything I learn — one command line, one lab, and one breakthrough at a time.

Right now, I’m focused on mastering **Blue Team skills** like log analysis, SIEM (Splunk), and network fundamentals. I’m using platforms like **TryHackMe**, real virtual machines, and hands-on projects like **BIZZ** — my own AI-powered cybersecurity assistant (In-Progress).

I also built and deployed my own **dynamic portfolio website** using Render, where I showcase everything I’ve learned so far through self-study and real projects.

This website isn’t just a portfolio — it’s living proof that with commitment, consistency, and self-belief, anyone can break into cybersecurity. I’m sharing my progress publicly to inspire others who feel like outsiders in tech. Because if I can do it — *you can too*.
