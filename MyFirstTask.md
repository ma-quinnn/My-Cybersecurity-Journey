# My First Step into Networking

## Date: [Wednesday, May 7 2025]

### Overview
Today, I began my journey into the fundamentals of computer networking as part of my cybersecurity learning roadmap. I focused on understanding how data moves across networks using the OSI and TCP/IP models and practiced these concepts in a lab on TryHackMe.

### What I Studied

#### OSI Model (7 Layers)
1. **Application** – Interface for user interaction (e.g., browser)
2. **Presentation** – Data translation & encryption
3. **Session** – Manages communication sessions
4. **Transport** – Ensures reliable data (TCP/UDP)
5. **Network** – IP addressing and routing (IP)
6. **Data Link** – MAC addressing, switches
7. **Physical** – Cables, signals, hardware

#### TCP/IP Model (4 Layers)
1. **Application**
2. **Transport**
3. **Internet**
4. **Network Access**

### Lab: TryHackMe - Intro to Networking

**Platform:** [TryHackMe - Intro to Networking](https://tryhackme.com/room/introtonetworking)

#### Tasks Completed:
- [ ] Task 1: Understanding IPs
- [ ] Task 2: Public vs Private IPs
- [ ] Task 3: Subnetting Basics
- [ ] Task 4: Ping, Traceroute, etc.
*(Check as you go)*

#### Key Learnings:
- The difference between private and public IPs
- How subnetting helps segment networks
- Basic tools like `ping`, `ipconfig`, and `tracert`

### Reflections
Understanding the OSI model really helped me visualize how each layer works. The TryHackMe room made it easier to apply these concepts practically. I feel more confident moving into deeper networking topics.

### Next Steps
- Finish the remaining TryHackMe tasks
- Begin studying **common network protocols** (HTTP, DNS, DHCP, etc.)
